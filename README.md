- 👋 Hi, I’m @Clay-Hamilton
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my technical knowhow so I can contribute to solving the biggest problems we face today (namely climate change and wealth inequality). 
  My dream is to work for a company on the cutting edge of the green revolution, where I can work on creating scalable programs to confront these issues head-on.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop and roll out my own full-stack application (currently working with React, Node.js, Java).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source public projects, in fields like urban planning, NY politics, and data collection in the field of green energy.
- 📫 How to reach me - clayham@gmail.com
